# news-keyword-tracker

This is a Python program that scrapes a list of news website pages to find certain keywords in the headlines of articles on the page, then sends an email to a specified address if these keywords appear.

This is a useful tool if one is trying to keep up to date on a developing news story but doesn't want to search for updates every day. They simply get an email if there are any new stories, and if they don't get anything it means that there are no new stories involving those keywords.

## Future Work and Extensions

Currently this only works by running the program manually but I'd like to find a way for it to run automatically each day without any prompting.
